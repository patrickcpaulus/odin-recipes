        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This sweet potato recipe is an adapation of 
            <a href="https://basicswithbabish.co/basicsepisodes/thanksgivingsides">
            Basics With Babish's</a> Thanskgiving Sides sweet potatoes dish, lightly modified 
            from my experiences making the dish for my family. Unlike many classic sweet potato 
            recipes, this one shies away from the marshamellows and heavy sugar use, and balances
            the natural sweetness from the potatoes with dried cranberries reconstituted in whiskey.
            The end result is a more complex flavor.

            While Bulleit bourbon is the recommended whiskey, any whiskey will do. For additional flavor
            development, the potatoes and sugar mixture can be sealed in freezer bags and refrigerated
            several hours up to overnight to massicate. Conversely, store-bought ricotta can be used in 
            lieu of the homemade stuff.
